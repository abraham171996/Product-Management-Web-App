# Product-Management-Web-App
This Git repository contains the source code for a web application that allows users to manage products.
The application provides a user-friendly interface for adding, viewing, searching, and deleting products. It utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, along with the Axios library for handling HTTP requests to the backend API. The backend API is expected to run on "http://localhost:3001" and is built to handle POST, GET, and DELETE requests for product data.

Key Features:

Add new products with details such as name, image URL, description, price, stock, category, and date.
Display all products in a responsive grid layout with product images, names, prices, and stock status.
Allow users to search for products by name, which dynamically filters the displayed products.
Display a star rating system for each product, allowing users to rate and see ratings for products.
Show stock availability for each product with different visual indicators (e.g., green for "In stock" and red for "Out of stock").
Enable product deletion by clicking the "Delete" button, triggering a DELETE request to the backend API.
Please note that this description is based on the provided code snippets, and the actual features and functionality may vary depending on the complete implementation. The repository may include additional files, documentation, or configurations required for running the application successfully.
